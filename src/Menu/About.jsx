        <h1>About Us:</h1><br />
        <p>Dance is a form of expression that brings people together, allows them to be creative in new ways, and is a fantastic way to escape the stresses and cares of everyday life. <br /><br />

We hear the thoughts of some of our students and professional tutors, to find out what they love most about dance, how it makes them feel, and what motivates them to dance in their spare time or as a career.</p>
